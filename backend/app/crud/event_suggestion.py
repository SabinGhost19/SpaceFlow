CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Preserve any explicit times provided in the text exactly (e.g., "09:00", "13:30"). Do NOT alter or round explicit times.
2. If times are ambiguous or relative (e.g., "in 2 hours", "after lunch"), infer and round sensibly to the nearest hour when needed.
3. If no participant count is mentioned, assume 1 person (DEFAULT).
4. Extract date information from the prompt (including relative dates like today/tomorrow) but prefer any explicit calendar date if provided.
5. Identify required amenities from the description (e.g., projector, whiteboard, video conference, WiFi).
6. Each activity should be a separate booking.
7. Support both English and Romanian language.

TIME PARSING GUIDELINES:
- If a line already has both start and end times (e.g., "from 09:00 to 11:00"), keep those exact values.
- If a specific minute is given (e.g., 14:30), keep it. Only round when the text is imprecise.
- For relative expressions ("in X hours/minutes", "for X hours"), compute from the provided context and round to the nearest hour as needed.

AMENITY KEYWORDS (English & Romanian):
- "projector", "projection", "screen", "videoproiector", "proiector" → "Projector"
- "whiteboard", "board", "tablă" → "Whiteboard"
- "video", "zoom", "teams", "conference call", "videoconferință" → "Video Conference"
- "wifi", "internet" → "WiFi"

MANDATORY:
- Do not output activities missing start_time or end_time.
- Return valid JSON only using the schema below (no extra commentary).

You must respond with valid JSON only, following this exact structure:
{
    "booking_date": "YYYY-MM-DD" or null if not specified,
    "activities": [
        {
            "name": "Activity name",
            "start_time": "HH:MM",
            "end_time": "HH:MM",
            "participants_count": 1,
            "required_amenities": ["Projector", "Whiteboard"],
            "preferences": "any specific preferences"
        }
    ],
    "extracted_preferences": "general preferences extracted from prompt"
}"""

        user_prompt = f"""Parse the following event request into structured activities.

USER REQUEST:
{prompt}

CURRENT CONTEXT:
- Current date and time: {current_datetime_str} ({current_day_name})
- Current rounded hour: {current_time}
- Next available hour: {next_slot}
- **TODAY'S DATE: {current_date.isoformat()} ({current_day_name})**
- **TOMORROW'S DATE: {tomorrow_date.isoformat()} ({(now + timedelta(days=1)).strftime("%A")})**
- **TARGET DATE SPECIFIED BY USER: {booking_date.isoformat() if booking_date else "NOT SPECIFIED - extract from prompt or use dates above"}**
- Additional preferences: {general_preferences or "None"}

USER'S EXISTING BOOKINGS (avoid these times):
{bookings_context}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **IF USER SPECIFIED A DATE IN THE CALENDAR ({booking_date.isoformat() if booking_date else 'N/A'}), USE THAT DATE!**
2. If user says "tomorrow"/"mâine" in prompt:
   - If no calendar date provided, use {tomorrow_date.isoformat()}
   - If calendar date IS provided, USE THE CALENDAR DATE (ignore "tomorrow" in prompt)
3. If user says "today"/"azi"/"astăzi":
   - If no calendar date provided, use {current_date.isoformat()}
   - If calendar date IS provided, USE THE CALENDAR DATE
4. Calculate relative times based on current context; preserve explicit times from the request without rounding.
5. AVOID suggesting or inventing times. Use only times that are either explicit in the text or clearly inferred from relative expressions.
6. If user says "available room" without specific time, use next available hour ({next_slot}).
7. For participant counts: default to 1 if not specified.
8. Extract amenities from keywords in the request.

EXAMPLES (ALL times at exact hours):
- Current hour {current_time}, "in 2 hours" → start_time: "{(rounded_now + timedelta(hours=2)).strftime('%H:00')}"
- Current hour {current_time}, "in 3 hours" → start_time: "{(rounded_now + timedelta(hours=3)).strftime('%H:00')}"
- "tomorrow at 3pm" / "mâine la 15:00" → booking_date: "{tomorrow_date.isoformat()}", start_time: "15:00"
- "today at 2pm" / "astăzi la 14:00" → booking_date: "{current_date.isoformat()}", start_time: "14:00"
- "available room with projector" → booking_date: "{current_date.isoformat()}", start_time: "{next_slot}", end_time: "{(rounded_now + timedelta(hours=2)).strftime('%H:00')}", amenities: ["Projector"]
- "pentru 2 ore" (for 2 hours) → start_time: "{next_slot}", end_time: "{(rounded_now + timedelta(hours=3)).strftime('%H:00')}"
- "cameră de meeting mâine" → booking_date: "{tomorrow_date.isoformat()}", start_time: "09:00" or "10:00"
